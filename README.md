# React native application example

With this app I was able to try out next things:

- How common web tools can help you building a native mobile app.
- What's differences with the traditional approach?
- How **Redux** is suitable for this work.

What I've learned:

- This is a brilliant way to create prototypes since development speed is super fast.
- Writing native modules in **Swift** and bridging them to **Javascript** runtime is not something difficult, so you won't need to deal much with **Objective-C** code.
- **React native** provides nice stuff for animating your app out of the box. But it may not have something you will need (I faced the lack of support for `transform-origin`). Most likely it is just a matter of time, I believe framework will implement it soon.
- Having some experience with a native code will be beneficial when you do things with **React native**. The same applies to experience with **Xcode** and other related tools (I was targeting iOS only).
- At the moment framework includes a lot of useful polyfills for **Javascript**, provided out of the box.
